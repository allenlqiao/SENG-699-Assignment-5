This project aims to practice:
1- Developing in groups using git 
2- basic skills dealing with binary numbers and bitwise operators in high level languages. 
Develop the following two projects as a group using git and host the project on github. The group is expected to breakdown the project into tasks and each student will develop part of the project, commit it locally then push it to the shared on-line repository. 
One advice: make sure you pull before you push - every time - ideally while using the pull rebase option.
